## What Does It Mean to Have a Stable, Satisfying Friendship?
> Do friendships have to compete with romantic relationships? The answer lies in how you communicate. Positive comments are key to establishing and maintaining a good relationship.  

### The Power of Positive Communication  

Imagine a salt shaker filled not with salt, but with all the ways to say "Yes!" Think of responses like:  
>- "Good point."  
>- "I see."  
>- "Yes."  
>- "That makes sense."  
>- "Tell me more."  
>- "You're starting to convince me."  
>- "I never thought of it that way."  
>- "If that’s so important to you, let’s find a way to make it happen."  
>- "Say more about how you feel and what you need."

Use this "Yes" shaker throughout your interactions, and you'll instantly become a master of relationships.

### The Dangers of Negative Communication

Now, imagine a salt shaker filled not with salt, but with all the ways to say "No!" Think of responses like:
>- "That’s ridiculous!"  
>- "No."  
>- "That is so stupid."  
>- "You're stupid!"  
>- "You're making no sense."  
>- "Be logical."  
>- "Shut up!"  
>- "Stop talking."  
>- "You're an idiot!"  
>- "You're a jerk!"  
>- "How can you be so insensitive?"
>- "You never cared about me."
>- "You're so selfish."

Use this "No" shaker, and you'll quickly become a disaster in relationships.

### The Difference Between Masters and Disasters

> Masters of relationships foster positive emotion, warmth, affection, support, interest, humor, understanding, and empathy. They say “yes” in various ways more often than they express “no” through anger, hostility, insult, disgust, contempt, sarcasm, sadness, disappointment, belittling, disagreement, or emotional withdrawal.
