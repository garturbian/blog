# The Dark Side of Big Pharma:

> In a recent episode of "The Whistleblowers" on RT, host John Kiriakou sat down with veteran journalist Martha Rosenberg to discuss the alarming influence of pharmaceutical and food industries on public health in the United States. The interview, which aired on September 15, 2024, shed light on the complex web of profit-driven practices that have led to a healthcare crisis in one of the world's wealthiest nations.

## The Pharmaceutical Boogeyman

> Rosenberg, author of "Big Food, Big Pharma, Big Lies," paints a grim picture of the pharmaceutical industry's tactics. "The big pharmaceutical companies are something of a boogeyman in the United States, and that's not by accident," she explains. "Pharmaceutical development is driven by profit, not altruism, and if a new medication is not cost-effective, it just simply isn't developed."

> The journalist highlights how pharmaceutical companies have capitalized on direct-to-consumer advertising, a practice legal only in the United States and New Zealand. This has led to a culture where Americans are led to believe they suffer from a myriad of conditions, many of which were barely recognized before such advertising began in 1998.

> "Americans look terrible but smell good," Rosenberg quips, pointing out the irony of a nation obsessed with personal hygiene products while struggling with obesity and chronic health issues.

## The Food Industry's Role

> The conversation then shifts to the food industry's contribution to the health crisis. Rosenberg explains how big agribusiness companies "produce foods that fatten and sicken people" using taxpayer money and government subsidies. She highlights the pernicious effects of high fructose corn syrup and the scandal surrounding "pink slime" in school lunches.

> "The bad food is driven by corporate profits, but it's also driven by... how foods were designed to be addictive," Rosenberg states, drawing parallels between junk food and the addictive nature of some pharmaceuticals.

## Medical Devices: A Hidden Danger

> The interview takes a sobering turn when discussing the medical device industry. Kiriakou shares a personal anecdote about his cousin's harrowing experience with a defective heart pump, highlighting the lack of scrutiny in the device approval process.

> Rosenberg warns, "The device industry... gets less coverage from reporters than the drugs. And it's probably less ethical because... they think that these devices have been scrutinized and tested by FDA or... the medical people and they often haven't been."

## A System in Crisis

> The discussion culminates in a stark realization: despite being the wealthiest country in the world, the United States has a medical system that leaves many behind. Rosenberg attributes this to a combination of factors, including aggressive marketing, corporate greed, and a lack of patient awareness.

> "Our lawmakers are captured," she asserts, referring to the influence of lobbyists on healthcare legislation. "For every Congress member, whether Senator or House, there's five lobbyists."

> As the interview concludes, Kiriakou poses a poignant question: "How can the wealthiest country in the world have the most expensive medical system in the world, a system that leaves the elderly, the needy and the poor behind?"

> The answer, it seems, lies in the complex interplay of corporate interests, regulatory failures, and a public health system that has lost sight of its primary mission: to heal and protect.
